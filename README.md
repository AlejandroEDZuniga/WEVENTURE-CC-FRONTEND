I have made the ToDo-app with create-react-app to have a professional and quality environment.
I have enjoyed doing this coding challenge by implementing the css and html files that have been provided above.
</br>
I have also used React-Redux as required.
</br>
I am looking forward to being part of your team and happy.

To run the project run the following commands:
</br>
npm i
</br>
npm start
